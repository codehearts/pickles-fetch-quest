    When following a target, the camera can be provided an easing function,

    the `STALKER-X <https://github.com/a327ex/STALKER-X>`_ camera for the
    `LÃ–VE <https://love2d.org>`_ Lua framework.

    Attributes:
        x (int): The x coordinate of the camera's lower left corner.
        y (int): The y coordinate of the camera's lower left corner.
        coordinates (:obj:`engine.geometry.Point2d`):
            The coordinates of the lower left corner as a :obj:`Point2d`.
        width (int): The width of the camera.
        height (int): The height of the camera.
        scale (float): The scaling to apply to the visible scene.
        follow (:obj:`game_object.GameObject` or None):
            A target for the camera to follow, or None for manual control.
        follow_easing (:obj:`easing.EasingCurve` or None):
            An easing curve to apply when following a target
        follow_lead (:obj:`geometry.Point2d`):
            Pixels for the camera to lead by when following a target in motion.

            Rectangular deadzone relative to the bottom left corner in which
            the camera won't follow the target.
